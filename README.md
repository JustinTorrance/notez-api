## What we learned
We learned how to effectively implement a backend. Creating a backend was a very interesting aspect of the project as our previous backend projects were pre-built.

## Challenges faced
This was the first time that any of us configured a backend. The process was different from the frontend, but the language was the same. Learning syntax and understanding the setup was the biggest challenge. 

## "Wins"
Testing on the backend was far more straight-forward than testing the frontend. We were all pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed setting-up this backend portion.
